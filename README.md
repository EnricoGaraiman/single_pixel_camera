# Implementation of Random Mask and Walsh-Hadamard Mask for Compressive Sensing Single Pixel Camera
This project implements the technique of compressive sensing single pixel camera using two types of masks: random mask and Walsh-Hadamard mask. This technique allows obtaining a compressed representation of images using only a single pixel and efficient reconstruction algorithms.
